Baseball. I love this sport! Specifically I love Dodgers Baseball and everything associated with the Chavez Ravine. With this being the final week of the offseason I've been catching up on all of my Dodgers news. From our left handed rotation to still crowded outfield to the uncertainty of the young kids coming up from the minors its exciting to get back into everything. This morning my family booked a week long baseball adventure to the East Coast for July and I am so excited to see Nationals Stadium, Camden Yards, and PNC Park. This photo, from the 2014 NLDS is an exciting reminder of things to come. Could this be our year? Let's end the 27 Year drought of no World Series visits or wins! 2016 - we are coming for you!
